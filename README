LINEAR ELASTIC COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (2D BEAM)

Originally written for the Spring 2013 MANE6680 Finite Element Programming course 
taught by Prof. Mark Shephard at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Current version
is specialized to compute node displacements in a mesh of 2D beam elements due to 
distributed pressures on the structure.

This code is being developed for future coupling with Prof. Jason Hicken's
Quasi 1D Euler solver as part of the MDA for multidisciplinary optimization 
algorithms.

DEPENDENCIES:
+ Boost
+ Quasi 1D Euler solver
+ Kona (indirect)
_________________________________________________________________________________
TO DO LIST (for Tuesday, May 14):

+ Write a short main program that establishes a test case and calls
all necessary functions.
_________________________________________________________________________________
MDA COUPLING (for Friday, May 17):

+ Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

+ Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates, which is then interrogated by
the flow solver for areas at particular X coordinates.

+ Write a pre-processing function that creates a vector of
pressure values per element based on the Quasi 1D Euler solver's
output

+ Figure out the gradients. (NEEDS A LOT OF WORK)
