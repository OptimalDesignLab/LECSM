Linear Elastic Computational Structural Analysis Program

Developed for the Spring 2013 MANE6680 Finite Element Programming course taught
by Prof. Mark Shephard at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Capable of calculating 
structural node displacements for 1-D or 2-D, structured or unstructured, linear 
or quadratic meshes as a result of nodal, edge or body loading. Allows prescribing
nodal displacements as boundary conditions.
