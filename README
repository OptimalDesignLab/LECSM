LINEAR ELASTIC COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (2D TRUSS)

Originally written for the Spring 2013 MANE6680 Finite Element Programming course 
taught by Prof. Mark Shephard at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Current version
is specialized to compute node displacements in a 2D truss mesh due to distributed
pressures on the truss. Finite Element Mesh Database (FMDB) dependency has been
removed and replaced with a purpose-built object-oriented 1D mesh library.

This code is being developed to be later coupled with Prof. Jason Hicken's
Quasi 1D Euler solver and used as part of the MDA for multidisciplinary optimization
algorithms.

TO DO LIST:

+ Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

+ Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates, which is then interrogated by
the flow solver for areas at particular X coordinates.

+ Finish writing header files.

+ Fix compile errors.

+ Build a set of test cases.
