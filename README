LINEAR ELASTIC COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (2D BEAM)

Originally written for the Spring 2013 MANE6680 Finite Element Programming course 
taught by Prof. Mark Shephard at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Current version
is specialized to compute node displacements in a mesh of 2D beam elements due to 
distributed pressures on the structure.

This code is being developed for coupling with Prof. Jason Hicken's
Quasi 1D Euler solver as part of the code MDA evaluation for multidisciplinary
design optimization applications. 

Repository for the aero-structural optimization project can be found here:

DESIGN NOTES:

+ + Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

+ Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates. The optimizer will control only
the Bspline, not the mesh coordinates.
