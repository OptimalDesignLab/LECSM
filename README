LINEAR ELASTIC COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS (2D BEAM)

Originally written for the Spring 2013 MANE6680 Finite Element Programming course 
taught by Prof. Mark Shephard at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Current version
is specialized to compute node displacements in a mesh of 2D beam elements due to 
distributed pressures on the structure.

This code is being developed for coupling with Prof. Jason Hicken's
Quasi 1D Euler solver as part of the code MDA evaluation for multidisciplinary
design optimization applications.
