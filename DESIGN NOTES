DESIGN NOTES
=================================================================
- Bspline::EvalAtPoints will give a vector of Y coordinates
that correspond to a vector of X coordinates on the Bspline.
Use this to create the mesh.

- Create a node object with:
	+ node ID (int)
	+ node coords (double, double)
	+ node type (int)
	+ prescribed displacement (double, double)
	+ prescribed nodal force (double, double)
	+ is edge load active? (int)

- Create an element object with:
	+ element ID (int)
	+ number of element nodes (int)
	+ number of integration points (int)
	+ nodes that define the element (node)

- Create a mesh object with:
	+ number of mesh nodes (int)
	+ number of space dimensions (int)
	+ number of mesh elements (int)
	+ list of elements in the mesh (elem)

- Fix Gaussian Quadrature rules for a 1-D mesh (2 nodes per element)

- 

- Use Bspline::FitCurve to generate analytical Bspline from
a set of X and Y coordinates, which is then interrogated by
the flow solver for areas at particular X coordinates.
